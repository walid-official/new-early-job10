# Full-Stack Web Application Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run a full-stack web application on localhost using React Router DOM, Firebase, MongoDB, Express, and JWT.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: For running the application.
- **MongoDB**: For database management (local or cloud-based).
- **Firebase**: For user authentication services.

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   Move into the directory containing your backend code.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `npm install` to install required packages such as Express, Mongoose, and JWT.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add variables like `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, and `JWT_SECRET`.

4. **Start the Backend Server**:
   Use `nodemon` or `node` to start your backend server. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or is accessible if using a cloud service.

## Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   Move into the directory containing your frontend code.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `npm install` to install necessary packages like React, React Router DOM, and Firebase.

3. **Configure Firebase**:
   Set up Firebase by adding your Firebase projectâ€™s configuration details. This includes API keys and other project identifiers.

4. **Start the Frontend Application**:
   Use `npm start` to run your React application. It should open in your default web browser.

## Connecting Frontend and Backend

1. **API Calls**:
   Ensure your frontend is set up to make API requests to your backend server. Use tools like `axios` for handling HTTP requests.

2. **Token Management**:
   Implement JWT for secure user sessions. Store tokens in local storage or cookies and attach them to API requests as needed.

## Running the Application

1. **Backend**: Start the backend server and ensure MongoDB is running.
2. **Frontend**: Start the frontend React application.
3. **Access**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Additional Tips

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling on both frontend and backend.
- **Role-Based Access**: Consider adding role-based access control for different user types.
- **Security**: Secure sensitive data and ensure API endpoints are protected.

## Conclusion

Follow these steps to successfully set up and run your full-stack web application on localhost. With React Router for navigation, Firebase for authentication, MongoDB for data storage, and Express with JWT for backend operations, this setup provides a robust framework for development.
